#project

This drupal website was a school project, the assignment was given by ISA (International Society of Automation). The goal was to give a proof of concept that drupal was able to fullfil all requirements for a community-based website for one of their districts.

#How to run

Due to the lack of a server we had to work local. The project requires to be in a folder 'projecten3' as we used that as our routing during the development. If not routing for the navigation and images will be messed up.

Run a local apache and mysql server (we used xampp). The project contains a drupal.sql file. Run that file in an empty database named 'drupal' and provide a user with username 'user' and password 'user'. Admin login for the website is 'admin' with password 'admin'.
